# Project_Chapter_12
Project based on the textbook "Automating Boring Tasks with Python". 
I downloaded the XLSX file from the Central Statistical Office website. 
Based on this file, the python script returns a window with a summary of the total number of Polish inhabitants in cities. 
How much area do these cities occupy and how many are there in total? The project uses the openpyxl module.
